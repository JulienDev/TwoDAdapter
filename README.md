TwoDAdapter
===========

Two Dimensional Adapter is an Android component. If you are familiar with Android UI you know AdapterViews like ListView, GridView. They all use view recycling and make your UI smooth while scrolling. The aim of TwoDAdapter is to bring you view recycling on both X and Y axis.

For the first release, this component is not exactly an adapter because it doesn't extend AdapterView and scroll is performed by a TwoDScrollView thanks to GORGES : http://blog.gorges.us/2010/06/android-two-dimensional-scrollview/ .
